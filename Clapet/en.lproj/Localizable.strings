In order to work, the app uses the utility `pmset`. This small program allows to
change battery settings like whether sleep is enabled or disabled. However it requires
root permissions to be ran. This means that if no changes are made the system will ask for
your password each time sleep gets either disabled or enabled which can get annoying.
